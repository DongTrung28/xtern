Visualisations:
train_dataset:
- 5 Distribution graphs

menu:
- 3 Distribution graphs

Findings:
Majors-Year:
The data might be useful for evaluating the popularity of different university majors over 2 years.
Business Outcome: Universities can use this analysis to assess program enrollment trends and make informed decisions about program offerings and resource allocation.
Business Outcome: Marketing teams can target specific demographics more effectively, and universities can tailor recruitment efforts.

Major-Univesrity:
Analyzing data by university can help identify which universities have more students participating and how the popularity of different majors within universities.
Business Outcome: Universities can use this analysis to assess the performance of their programs and make data-driven improvements.

Time-Order
Analyzing the time and order, restaurants can see what orders are popular at a specific time.
Business Outcome: Restaurants can use this information to allocate resources and improve their income

Biases:
From the current dataset, there are certain biases:
- First bias can be seen in the Major Distribution graph. 20 majors but the frequency in each major are not the same. From the graph, it can be seen clearly how some of the top majors has a hugh range compare to the lower majors. This could make certain bias when creating a model.
- Second bias can be seen in the University Distribution graph. 10 universities but the frequency of each university are not the same. From the graph, it can be seen clearly how some of the popular universities has a hugh range compare to the less popular universities. This could make certain bias when creating a model.
