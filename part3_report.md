Based on the information and the dataset given, I have determined that this is a classification problem and with that came many options. I could have used Logistic Regression or ensemble methods like Random Forest but in the end I picked Decision Tree. I chose the Decision Tree algorithm for this classification problem due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness for tabular data. Decision Trees are well-suited for problems where the relationship between input features (major, university, year, and time) and the target variable (customer order) can be nonlinear and complex. Their intuitive structure allows for easy visualization and understanding of the decision-making process, which is essential for transparency and model explainability. Additionally, Decision Trees can handle both categorical and numerical features, making them suitable for this dataset, which contains a mix of these data types. Even though in the end, I got a result of 66% which I believe is a terrible results. I still think Decision Tree is the way to go. I believe my mistakes are from the dataset which has biases that I havenâ€™t eliminate. Given more time, I would be able to preprocess my data better to achieve a better results.
